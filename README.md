# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains code aimed at to simplify finding good gene therapy candidates based on certain parameters. Inside includes files various gene databases as well as code that utilizes them. The code cleans up the database files as well as provides ways to filter to find gene candidates for AAV, Lentivirus, and LNP based vectors. It also provides examples for code when more databases are added that may include gene information such as Tropism and disease prevalence.
